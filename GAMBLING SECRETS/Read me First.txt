MASTER THE ART OF TEXAS HOLDEM!

The following tutorial will outline how it is possible to earn a substantial amount of money every month playing online poker. The online poker industry raked in over $10 Billion last year and is estimated to bring in over $100 billion at the close of 2006. It is the fastest growing industry in the world. that being said the market is by no means saturated and even if 1000 people a day read and followed these tutorials it would by no means make the slightest difference to the playing style described here and your earning potential.
You will make this money by using one of the free poker tools.

These tools can be obtained absolutely free just follow the links provided, a small money deposit of $20 may be required just to verify age and release the licence key but the money is still yours so the software is free. Even if you are an experienced poker player it is advised to get the calculators as they will correct bad play and train your mind with pot odds statistics and general play scenarios improving your game all round including offline play.     

TIGHT AGGRESSIVE PLAY

If there are no constants in gambling the house/other players will always win. You can control this in poker by using the calculators and always playing a constant (we are all prone to human emotion, this is a poker players worst enemy) By using the calculators and playing at a constant we can manipulate the poker table to a considerable advantage, there by removing the gambling and luck element. Sure your going lose and your going have bad beats, but you will win more than you lose. You will lose far more if you deviate from the calculator, so don't!!! Watch the demos then go get your calculators and start winning. Warning!!! Don't play Hi limit, stick to Low limit where there are new players and the pickings are easy. It will take between 6 and 8 hours a day( a days work), but hey what a way to make a living and a good one at that. 

Profit margins based on a $6+0.50c low limit game on pokerstars, using the Calculatempro and Holdem Genius auto card readers at the same time on the same table.



LEVEL 1 

These margins are taking into account that you place in the money 7 out of every 10 games that you play using the calculators  (i.e. you finish either 1st, 2st, 3rd)
approximate time 7 hours a day to complete 10 x $6 turbo sit and go tournaments. 


WORST CASE A DAY  =   $10  PROFIT
MEDIUM CASE  =  $48.40 PROFIT
BEST CASE  = $124 PROFIT

LEVEL 2

WORST CASE  = $29 PROFIT 
MEDIUM CASE  = $120 PROFIT
BEST CASE  = $312.50 PROFIT


LAST LEVEL DO NOT GO PAST THIS LEVEL UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE SYSTEM FOR AT LEAST 2 MONTHS AND ARE CAPABLE OF STICKING TO THE CALCULATORS!!!!
LEVEL 3

WORST CASE  = $45 PROFIT
MEDIUM CASE  = $202.50 PROFIT
BEST CASE  = $$585 PROFIT 


$585 X $30DAYS = $17.550 Given that you wont always be playing level 3 and wont always win, you should average between $5000 & $10 000 a month playing this system.
