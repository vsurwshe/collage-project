<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.1] What is this &quot;newbie section&quot; all about?</h3></div>
<p>It's a <em>randomly ordered</em> collection containing a <em>few</em> questions
newbies <em>might</em> ask.
<ul>
<li>This section doesn't pretend to be organizied.  Think of it as
random.  In truth, think of it as a hurried, initial cut by a busy
guy.</li>
<li>This section doesn't pretend to be complete.  Think of it as
offering a little help to a few people.  It won't help everyone and it might
not help you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully someday I'll be able to improve this section, but for now, it is
incomplete and unorganized.  If that bothers you, my suggestion is to click
that little <tt>x</tt> on the extreme upper right of your browser window <nobr><tt>:-)</tt></nobr>.

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.4] Should I use <nobr><tt>f(void)</tt></nobr> or <nobr><tt>f()</tt></nobr>?</h3></div>
<p><nobr><tt>f()</tt></nobr>
<p>C programmers often use <nobr><tt>f(void)</tt></nobr> when declaring a function that takes
no parameters, however in C++ that is considered bad style.  In fact, the
<nobr><tt>f(void)</tt></nobr> style has been called
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/sibling_rivalry.pdf" title="www.research.att.com/~bs/sibling_rivalry.pdf" target='_blank'>an
&quot;abomination&quot;</a> by Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, Dennis
Ritchie, the co-creator of C, and Doug McIlroy, head of the research
department where Unix was born.
<p>If you're writing C++ code, you should use <nobr><tt>f()</tt></nobr>.  The <nobr><tt>f(void)</tt></nobr>
style is legal in C++, but only to make it easier to compile C code.
<p>This C++ code shows the best way to declare a function that takes no
parameters:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;void&nbsp;f();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;declares&nbsp;(not&nbsp;defines)&nbsp;a&nbsp;function&nbsp;that&nbsp;takes&nbsp;no&nbsp;parameters</em><tt>
</tt>
</div>
<p>This C++ code both declares and defines a function that takes no parameters:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;void&nbsp;f()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;declares&nbsp;and&nbsp;defines&nbsp;a&nbsp;function&nbsp;that&nbsp;takes&nbsp;no&nbsp;parameters</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p>The following C++ code also declares a function that takes no parameters, but
it uses the less desirable (some would say &quot;abomination&quot;) style,
<nobr><tt>f(void)</tt></nobr>:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;void&nbsp;f(void);&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;undesirable&nbsp;style&nbsp;for&nbsp;C++;&nbsp;use&nbsp;<nobr><tt>void&nbsp;f()</tt></nobr>&nbsp;instead</em><tt>
</tt>
</div>
<p>Actually this <nobr><tt>f()</tt></nobr> thing is all you need to know about C++.  That and
using those new fangled <nobr><tt>//</tt></nobr> comments.  Once you know those two things,
you can claim to be a C++ expert.  Go for it: type those magical &quot;++&quot; marks on
your resume.  Who cares about all that OO stuff &#151; why should you bother
changing the way you <em>think</em>?  After all, the really important thing
isn't thinking; it's typing in function declarations and comments.  (Sigh; I
wish nobody actually thought that way.)

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.5] What are the criteria for choosing between <tt>short</tt> / <tt>int</tt> / <tt>long</tt> data types?</h3></div>
<p>Other related questions: If a <nobr><tt>short int</tt></nobr> is the same size as an <tt>int</tt>
on my particular implementation, why choose one or the other?  If I start
taking the actual size in bytes of the variables into account, won't I be
making my code unportable (since the size in bytes may differ from
implementation to implementation)?  Or should I simply go with sizes much
larger than I actually need, as a sort of safety buffer?
<p>Answer: It's usually a good idea to write code that can be ported to a
different operating system and/or compiler.  After all, if you're successful
at what you do, someone else might want to use it somewhere else.  This can be
a little tricky with built-in types like <tt>int</tt> and <tt>short</tt>, since C++ doesn't
give guaranteed sizes.  However C++ does give you guaranteed <em>minimum</em>
sizes, and that will usually be all you need to know.
<p>C++ guarantees <a href="intrinsic-types.html#faq-26.1" title="[26.1] Can sizeof(char) be 2 on some machines? For example, what about double-byte characters?">a <tt>char</tt> is exactly one byte<!--rawtext:[26.1]:rawtext--></a>, <tt>short</tt>
is at least 2 bytes, <tt>int</tt> is at least 2 bytes, and <tt>long</tt> is at least 4
bytes.  It also guarantees the <tt>unsigned</tt> version of each of these is the same
size as the original, for example, <nobr><tt>sizeof(unsigned short) ==
sizeof(short)</tt></nobr>.
<p>When writing portable code, you shouldn't make additional assumptions about
these sizes.  For example, don't assume <tt>int</tt> has 4 bytes.  If you have an
integral variable that needs at least 4 bytes, use a <tt>long</tt> or <nobr><tt>unsigned
long</tt></nobr> even if <nobr><tt>sizeof(int) == 4</tt></nobr> on your particular implementation.
On the other hand, if you have an integral variable quantity that will always
fit within 2 bytes <em>and</em> if you want to minimize the use of data memory,
use a <tt>short</tt> or <nobr><tt>unsigned short</tt></nobr> even if you know <nobr><tt>sizeof(int) ==
2</tt></nobr> on your particular implementation.
<p>Note that there are some subtle tradeoffs here.  In some cases, your computer
might be able to manipulate smaller things faster than bigger things, but in
other cases it is exactly the opposite: <tt>int</tt> arithmetic might be faster than
<tt>short</tt> arithmetic on some implementations.  Another tradeoff is data-space
against code-space: <tt>int</tt> arithmetic might generate less binary code than
<tt>short</tt> arithmetic on some implementations.  Don't make simplistic
assumptions.  Just because a particular variable <em>can</em> be declared as
<tt>short</tt> doesn't necessarily mean it <em>should</em>, even if you're trying to
save space.

<p><a name="faq-29.6"></a>
<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.6] What the heck is a <tt>const</tt> variable? Isn't that a contradiction in terms?</h3></div>
<p>If it bothers you, call it a &quot;<tt>const</tt> identifier&quot; instead.
<p>The main issue is to figure out what it <em>is</em>; we can figure out what to
call it later.  For example, consider the symbol <tt>max</tt> in the following
function:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;void&nbsp;f()<br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;int&nbsp;max&nbsp;=&nbsp;107;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float&nbsp;array[max];<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p>It doesn't matter whether you call <tt>max</tt> a <tt>const</tt> variable or a <tt>const</tt>
identifier.  What matters is that you realize it is like a normal variable in
some ways (e.g., you can take its address or pass it by const-reference), but
it is unlike a normal variable in that you can't change its value.
<p>Here is another even more common example:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;class&nbsp;Fred&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;public:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;private:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static&nbsp;const&nbsp;int&nbsp;max_&nbsp;=&nbsp;107;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;};
</tt>
</div>
<p>In this example, you would need to add the line <nobr><tt>int Fred::max_;</tt></nobr> in
exactly one .cpp file, typically in <tt>Fred.cpp</tt>.
<p>It is generally considered good programming practice to
<a href="newbie.html#faq-29.11" title="[29.11] Is it okay if a lot of numbers appear in my code?">give each &quot;magic number&quot; (like 107) a symbolic
name and use that name rather than the raw magic number<!--rawtext:[29.11]:rawtext--></a>.

<p><a name="faq-29.7"></a>
<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.7] Why would I use a <tt>const</tt> variable / <tt>const</tt> identifier as opposed to <nobr><tt>#define</tt></nobr>?</h3></div>
<p><tt>const</tt> identifiers are often better than <nobr><tt>#define</tt></nobr> because:
<ul>
<li>they obey the language's scoping rules</li>
<li>you can see them in the debugger</li>
<li>you can take their address if you need to</li>
<li>you can pass them by <tt>const</tt>-reference if you need to</li>
<li>they don't create new &quot;keywords&quot; in your program.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, <tt>const</tt> identifiers act like they're part of the language because
they <em>are</em> part of the language.  The preprocessor can be thought of as
a language layered on top of C++.  You can imagine that the preprocessor runs
as a separate pass through your code, which would mean your original source
code would be seen only by the preprocessor, not by the C++ compiler itself.
In other words, you can imagine the preprocessor sees your original source
code and replaces all <nobr><tt>#define</tt></nobr> symbols with their values, <em>then</em> the
C++ compiler proper sees the modified source code <em>after</em> the original
symbols got replaced by the preprocessor.
<p>There are cases where <nobr><tt>#define</tt></nobr> is needed, but you should generally avoid it
when you have the choice.  You should evaluate whether to use <tt>const</tt>
<em>vs.</em> <nobr><tt>#define</tt></nobr> based on business value: time, money, risk.  In other
words, one size does not fit all.  Most of the time you'll use <tt>const</tt> rather
than <nobr><tt>#define</tt></nobr> for constants, but sometimes you'll use <nobr><tt>#define</tt></nobr>.  But please
remember to wash your hands afterwards.

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.9] What is the &quot;standard library&quot;? What is included / excluded from it?</h3></div>
<p>Most (not all) implementations have a &quot;standard include&quot; directory, sometimes
directories plural.  If your implementation is like that, the headers in the
standard library are probably a subset of the files in those directories.  For
example, <tt>iostream</tt> and <tt>string</tt> are part of the standard library,
as is <tt>cstring</tt> and <tt>cstdio</tt>.  There are a bunch of .h files that
are also part of the standard libarary, but not every .h file in those
directories is part of the standard library.  For example, <tt>stdio.h</tt> is
but <tt>windows.h</tt> is not.
<p>You include headers from the standard library like this:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.10] How should I lay out my code? When should I use spaces, tabs, and/or newlines in my code?</h3></div>
<p>The short answer is: <em>Just like the rest of your team</em>.  In other words,
the team should use a consistent approach to whitespace, but otherwise please
don't waste a lot of time worrying about it.
<p>Here are a few details:
<p>There is no universally accepted coding standard when it comes to whitespace.
There are a few popular whitespace standards, such as the &quot;one true brace&quot;
style, but there is a lot of contention over certain aspects of any given
coding standard.
<p>Most whitespace standards agree on a few points, such as putting a space
around infix operators like <nobr><tt>x * y</tt></nobr> or <nobr><tt>a - b</tt></nobr>.  Most (not all)
whitespace standards do not put spaces around the <nobr><tt>[</tt></nobr> or <nobr><tt>]</tt></nobr> in
<nobr><tt>a[i]</tt></nobr>, and similar comments for <nobr><tt>(</tt></nobr> and <nobr><tt>)</tt></nobr> in
<nobr><tt>f(x)</tt></nobr>.  However there is a great deal of contention over vertical
whitespace, particularly when it comes to <nobr><tt>{</tt></nobr> and <nobr><tt>}</tt></nobr>.  For
example, here are a few of the many ways to lay out <nobr><tt>if (foo()) { bar();
baz(); }</tt></nobr>:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(foo())&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bar();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baz();<br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(foo())<br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bar();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baz();<br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(foo())<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bar();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baz();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(foo())<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bar();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baz();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(foo())&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bar();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baz();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p>...and others...
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Do <em>NOT</em> email me with reasons your whitespace
approach is better than the others.  I don't care.  Plus I won't believe you.
There is <em>no</em> objective standard of &quot;better&quot; when it comes to whitespace
so your opinion is just that: your opinion.  If you write me an email in spite
of this paragraph, I will consider you to be a hopeless geek who focuses on
nits.  Don't waste your time worrying about whitespace: as long as your team
uses a consistent whitespace style, get on with your life and worry about more
important things.
<p>For example, things you <em>should</em> be worried about include design issues
like when <a href="abcs.html#faq-22.3" title="[22.3] What is an ABC?">ABCs<!--rawtext:[22.3]:rawtext--></a> should be used, whether inheritance should
be an implementation or specification technique, what testing and inspection
strategies should be used, whether interfaces should uniformly have a <nobr><tt>get()</tt></nobr>
and/or <nobr><tt>set()</tt></nobr> member function for each data member, whether interfaces should
be designed from the outside-in or the inside-out, whether errors be handled
by <tt>try</tt>/<tt>catch</tt>/<tt>throw</tt> or by return codes, etc.  Read the FAQ for some
opinions on those important questions, but please don't waste your time
arguing over whitespace.  As long as the team is using a consistent whitespace
strategy, drop it.

<p><a name="faq-29.11"></a>
<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.11] Is it okay if a lot of numbers appear in my code?</h3></div>
<p>Probably not.
<p>In many (not all) cases, it's best to <em>name</em> your numbers so each number
appears only once in your code.  That way, when the number changes there will
only be one place in the code that has to change.
<p>For example, suppose your program is working with shipping crates.  The weight
of an empty crate is <tt>5.7</tt>.  The expression <nobr><tt>5.7 + contentsWeight</tt></nobr>
probably means the weight of the crate including its contents, meaning the
number <tt>5.7</tt> probably appear many times in the software.  All these
occurances of the number <tt>5.7</tt> will be difficult to find and change when
(not if) somebody changes the style of crates used in this application.  The
solution is to make sure the value <tt>5.7</tt> appears <em>exactly once</em>,
usually as the initializer for a <tt>const</tt> identifier.  Typically this will be
something like <nobr><tt>const double crateWeight = 5.7;</tt></nobr>.  After that, <nobr><tt>5.7 +
contentsWeight</tt></nobr> would be replaced by <nobr><tt>crateWeight + contentsWeight</tt></nobr>.
<p>Now that's the general rule of thumb.  But unfortunately there is some fine
print.
<p>Some people believe one should <em>never</em> have numeric literals scattered
in the code.  They believe <em>all</em> numeric values should be named in a
manner similar to that described above.  That rule, however noble in intent,
just doesn't work very well in practice.  It is too tedious for people to
follow, and ultimately it costs companies more than it saves them.  Remember:
the goal of all programming rules is to <em>reduce</em> time, cost and risk.
If a rule actually makes things worse, it is a bad rule, period.
<p>A more practical rule is to focus on those values that are likely to change.
For example, if a numeric literal is likely to change, it should appear only
once in the software, usually as the initializer of a <tt>const</tt> identifier.
This rule lets unchanging values, such as some occurances of 0, 1, -1, etc.,
get coded directly in the software so programmers don't have to search for the
one true definition of <tt>one</tt> or <tt>zero</tt>.  In other words, if a
programmer wants to loop over the indices of a <tt>vector</tt>, he can simply
write <nobr><tt>for (int i = 0; i &lt; v.size(); ++i)</tt></nobr>.  The &quot;extremist&quot; rule
described earlier would require the programmer to poke around asking if
anybody else has defined a <tt>const</tt> identifier initialized to 0, and if not, to
define his own <nobr><tt>const int zero = 0;</tt></nobr> then replace the loop with <nobr><tt>for
(int i = zero; i &lt; v.size(); ++i)</tt></nobr>.  This is all a waste of time since the
loop will <em>always</em> start with 0.  It adds cost without adding any value
to compensate for that cost.
<p>Obviously people might argue over exactly which values are &quot;likely to change,&quot;
but that kind of judgment is why you get paid the big bucks: do your job and
make a decision.  Some people are so afraid of making a wrong decision that
they'll adopt a one-size-fits-all rule such as &quot;give a name to <em>every</em>
number.&quot; But if you adopt rules like that, you're <em>guaranteed</em> to have
made the wrong decision: those rules cost your company more than they save.
They are bad rules.
<p>The choice is simple: use a flexible rule even though you <em>might</em> make a
wrong decision, or use a one-size-fits-all rule and be <em>guaranteed</em> to
make a wrong decision.
<p>There is one more piece of fine print: <em>where</em> the <tt>const</tt> identifier
should be defined.  There are three typical cases:
<ul>
<li>If the <tt>const</tt> identifier is used only within a single function, it
can be local to that function.</li>
<li>If the <tt>const</tt> identifier is used throughout a class and no where
else, it can be <tt>static</tt> within the <tt>private</tt> part of that class.</li>
<li>If the <tt>const</tt> identifier is used in numerous classes, it can be
<tt>static</tt> within the <tt>public</tt> part of the most appropriate class, or perhaps
<tt>private</tt> in that class with a <tt>public</tt> <tt>static</tt> access method.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a last resort, make it <tt>static</tt> within a namespace or perhaps put it
in the unnamed namespace.  Try very hard to avoid using <nobr><tt>#define</tt></nobr> since

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.12] What's the point of the <tt>L</tt>, <tt>U</tt> and <tt>f</tt> suffixes on numeric literals?</h3></div>
<p>You should use these suffixes when you need to force the compiler to treat the
numeric literal as if it was the specified type.  For example, if <tt>x</tt> is
of type <tt>float</tt>, the expression <nobr><tt>x + 5.7</tt></nobr> is of type double: it first
promotes the value of <tt>x</tt> to a <tt>double</tt>, then performs the arithmetic
using double-precision instructions.  If that is what you want, fine; but if
you really wanted it to do the arithmetic using single-precision instructions,
you can change that code to <nobr><tt>x + 5.7f</tt></nobr>.  Note: it is
<a href="newbie.html#faq-29.11" title="[29.11] Is it okay if a lot of numbers appear in my code?">even better to &quot;name&quot; your numeric literals,
particularly those that are likely to change<!--rawtext:[29.11]:rawtext--></a>.  That would require you to
say <nobr><tt>x + crateWeight</tt></nobr> where <tt>crateWeight</tt> is a <tt>const</tt> <tt>float</tt>
that is initialized to <tt>5.7f</tt>.
<p>The <tt>U</tt> suffix is similar.  It's probably a good idea to use unsigned
integers for variables that are always &gt;= 0.  For example, if a variable
represents an index into an array, that variable would typically be declared
as an <tt>unsigned</tt>.  The main reason for this is it requires less code, at least
if you are careful to check your ranges.  For example, to check if a variable
is both &gt;= 0 and &lt; max requires two tests if everything is signed: <nobr><tt>if (n
&gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; n &lt; max)</tt></nobr>, but can be done with a single comparison if everything
is unsigned: <nobr><tt>if (n &lt; max)</tt></nobr>.
<p>If you end up using unsigned variables, it is generally a good idea to force
your numeric literals to also be unsigned.  That makes it easier to see that
the compiler will generate &quot;unsigned arithmetic&quot; instructions.  For example:
<nobr><tt>if (n &lt; 256U)</tt></nobr> or <nobr><tt>if ((n &amp; 255u) &lt; 32u)</tt></nobr>.  Mixing signed and
unsigned values in a single arithmetic expression is often confusing for
programmers &#151; the compiler doesn't always do what you expect it should do.
<p>The <tt>L</tt> suffix is not as common, but it is occasionally used for similar
reasons as above: to make it obvious that the compiler is using <tt>long</tt>
arithmetic.
<p>The bottom line is this: it is a good discipline for programmers to force all
numeric operands to be of the right type, as opposed to relying on the C++
rules for promoting/demoting numeric expressions.  For example, if <tt>x</tt>
is of type <tt>int</tt> and <tt>y</tt> is of type <tt>unsigned</tt>, it is a good idea to
change <nobr><tt>x + y</tt></nobr> so the next programmer knows whether you intended to use
unsigned arithmetic, e.g., <nobr><tt>unsigned(x) + y</tt></nobr>, or signed arithmetic:
<nobr><tt>x + int(y)</tt></nobr>.  The other possibility is long arithmetic: <nobr><tt>long(x) +
long(y)</tt></nobr>.  By using those casts, the code is more explicit and that's good
in this case, since a lot of programmers don't know all the rules for implicit
promotions.

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.13] I can understand the <em>and</em> (<nobr><tt>&amp;&amp;</tt></nobr>) and <em>or</em> (<nobr><tt>||</tt></nobr>) operators, but what's the purpose of the <em>not</em> (<nobr><tt>!</tt></nobr>) operator?</h3></div>
<p>Some people are confused about the <nobr><tt>!</tt></nobr> operator.  For example, they think that
<nobr><tt>!true</tt></nobr> is the same as <tt>false</tt>, or that <a href="newbie.html#faq-29.14" title="[29.14] Is !(a &lt; b) logically the same as a &gt;= b?"><nobr><tt>!(a &lt; b)</tt></nobr> is the same as <nobr><tt>a &gt;= b</tt></nobr><!--rawtext:[29.14]:rawtext--></a>, so in both cases the <nobr><tt>!</tt></nobr>
operator doesn't seem to add anything.
<p>Answer: The <nobr><tt>!</tt></nobr> operator is useful in boolean expressions, such occur in an
<tt>if</tt> or <tt>while</tt> statement.  For example, let's assume <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>
are boolean expressions, perhaps simple method-calls that return a <tt>bool</tt>.
There are all sorts of ways to combine these two expressions:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(&nbsp;A&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B)&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(!A&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B)&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(&nbsp;A&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;!B)&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(!A&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;!B)&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(!(&nbsp;A&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B))&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(!(!A&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B))&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(!(&nbsp;A&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;!B))&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(!(!A&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;!B))&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt>
</tt>
</div>
<p>Along with a similar group formed using the <nobr><tt>||</tt></nobr> operator.
<p>Note: boolean algebra can be used to transform each of the <nobr><tt>&amp;&amp;</tt></nobr>-versions into
an equivalent <nobr><tt>||</tt></nobr>-version, so from a truth-table standpoint there are only 8
logically distinct <tt>if</tt> statements.  However, since readability is so
important in software, programmers should consider both the <nobr><tt>&amp;&amp;</tt></nobr>-version and
the logically equivalent <nobr><tt>||</tt></nobr>-version.  For example, programmers should choose
between <nobr><tt>!A &amp;&amp; !B</tt></nobr> and <nobr><tt>!(A || B)</tt></nobr> based on which one is more
obvious to whoever will be maintaining the code.  In that sense there really
are 16 different choices.
<p>The point of all this is simple: the <nobr><tt>!</tt></nobr> operator is quite useful in boolean
expressions.  Sometimes it is used for readability, and sometimes it is used
because expressions like <nobr><tt>!(a &lt; b)</tt></nobr> actually are
<a href="newbie.html#faq-29.14" title="[29.14] Is !(a &lt; b) logically the same as a &gt;= b?"><em>not</em><!--rawtext:[29.14]:rawtext--></a> equivalent to <nobr><tt>a &gt;= b</tt></nobr> in

<p>No!
<p>Despite what your grade school math teacher taught you, these equivalences
don't always work in software, especially with floating point expressions or
user-defined types.
<p>Example: if <tt>a</tt> is a floating point <a href="newbie.html#faq-29.15" title="[29.15] What is this NaN thing?">NaN<!--rawtext:[29.15]:rawtext--></a>, then both <nobr><tt>a

<p>Example: if <tt>a</tt> is an object of class <tt>Foo</tt> that has overloaded

probably <em>should</em> have opposite semantics, but that's up to whoever

<p><a name="faq-29.15"></a>
<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.15] What is this NaN thing?</h3></div>
<p>NaN means &quot;not a number,&quot; and is used for floating point operations.
<p>There are lots of floating point operations that don't make sense, such as
dividing by zero, taking the log of zero or a negative number, taking the
square root of a negative number, etc.  Depending on your compiler, some of
these operations may produce special floating point values such as infinity
(with distinct values for positive <em>vs.</em> negative infinity) and the
<em>not a number</em> value, NaN.
<p>If your compiler produces a NaN, it has the unusual property that it is not
equal to any value, including itself.  For example, if <tt>a</tt> is NaN, then
<nobr><tt>a == a</tt></nobr> is false.  That is the usual way to check if you are dealing
with a NaN:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;void&nbsp;funct(double&nbsp;x)<br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;(x&nbsp;==&nbsp;x)&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;<tt>x</tt>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal&nbsp;value</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;else&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;<tt>x</tt>&nbsp;is&nbsp;NaN</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p>Similarly, if <tt>a</tt> is NaN and <tt>b</tt> is some arbitrary floating point
value, <tt>a</tt> will be neither less than, equal to, nor greater than
<tt>b</tt>.  In other words, <nobr><tt>a &lt; b</tt></nobr>, <nobr><tt>a &lt;= b</tt></nobr>, <nobr><tt>a &gt; b</tt></nobr>,
<nobr><tt>a &gt;= b</tt></nobr>, and <nobr><tt>a == b</tt></nobr> will all return false.

<p>Disclaimer: Frustration with rounding/truncation/approximation isn't really a
C++ issue; it's a computer science issue.  However, people keep asking about
it on <a href="news:comp.lang.c++" title="comp.lang.c++"><tt>comp.lang.c++</tt></a>, so what follows is a nominal answer.
<p>Answer: Floating point is an approximation.  The IEEE standard for 32 bit
float supports 1 bit of sign, 8 bits of exponent, and 23 bits of mantissa.
Since a normalized binary-point mantissa always has the form 1.xxxxx... the
leading 1 is dropped and you get effectively 24 bits of mantissa.  The number
1000.43 (and many, many others, including some really common ones like 0.1) is
not exactly representable in float or double format.  1000.43 is actually
represented as the following bitpattern (the &quot;<tt>s</tt>&quot; shows the position of
the sign bit, the &quot;<tt>e</tt>&quot;s show the positions of the exponent bits, and
the &quot;<tt>m</tt>&quot;s show the positions of the mantissa bits):
<p><div class=CodeBlock>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01000100011110100001101110000101
</tt>
</div>
<p>The shifted mantissa is 1111101000.01101110000101 or 1000 + 7045/16384.  The
fractional part is 0.429992675781.  With 24 bits of mantissa you only get
about 1 part in 16M of precision for float.  The <tt>double</tt> type provides more
precision (53 bits of mantissa).

<p><a name="faq-29.17"></a>
<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.17] Why doesn't my floating-point comparison work?</h3></div>
<p>Because floating point arithmetic is different from real number arithmetic.
<p>Bottom line: Never use <nobr><tt>==</tt></nobr> to compare two floating point numbers.
<p>Here's a simple example:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;double&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.0&nbsp;/&nbsp;10.0;<br>
&nbsp;double&nbsp;y&nbsp;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;*&nbsp;10.0;<br>
&nbsp;if&nbsp;(y&nbsp;!=&nbsp;1.0)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;&quot;surprise:&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;y&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;!=&nbsp;1\n&quot;;
</tt>
</div>
<p>The above &quot;surprise&quot; message will appear on some (but not all)
compilers/machines.  But even if your particular compiler/machine doesn't
cause the above &quot;surprise&quot; message (and if you write me telling me whether it
does, you'll show you've missed the whole point of this FAQ), floating point
will surprise you at some point.  So read this FAQ and you'll know what to do.
<p>The reason floating point will surprise you is that <tt>float</tt> and
<tt>double</tt> values are normally represented using a finite precision binary
format.  In other words, floating point numbers are not real numbers.  For
example, in your machine's floating point format it might be impossible to
exactly represent the number 0.1.  By way of analogy, it's impossible to
exactly represent the number <em>one third</em> in decimal format (unless you
use an infinite number of digits).
<p>To dig a little deeper, let's examine what the decimal number 0.625 means.
This number has a 6 in the &quot;tenths&quot; place, a 2 in the &quot;hundreths&quot; place, and a
5 in the &quot;thousanths&quot; place.  In other words, we have a <em>digit</em> for each
power of <em>10</em>.  But in binary, we might, depending on the details of
your machine's floating point format, have a <em>bit</em> for each power of
<em>2</em>.  So the fractional part might have a &quot;halves&quot; place, a &quot;quarters&quot;
place, an &quot;eighths&quot; place, &quot;sixteenths&quot; place, etc., and each of these places
has a bit.
<p>Let's pretend your machine represents the fractional part of floating point
numbers using the above scheme (it's normally more complicated than that, but
if you already know exactly how floating point numbers are stored, chances are
you don't need this FAQ to begin with, so look at this as a good starting
point).  On that pretend machine, the bits of the fractional part of 0.625
would be 101: 1 in the &#189;-place, 0 in the &#188;-place, and 1 in the
&#8539;-place.  In other words, 0.625 is &#189; + &#8539;.
<p>But on this pretend machine, 0.1 cannot be represented exactly since it cannot
be formed as a sum of a finite number of powers of 2.  You can get close but
you can't represent it exactly.  In particular you'd have a 0 in the
&#189;-place, a 0 in the &#188;-place, a 0 in the &#8539;-place, and finally a 1
in the &quot;sixteenths&quot; place, leaving a remainder of 1/10 - 1/16 = 3/80.
Figuring out the other bits is left as an exercise (hint: look for a repeating
bit-pattern, analogous to trying to represent 1/3 or 1/7 in decimal format).
<p>The message is that some floating point numbers cannot always be represented
exactly, so comparisons don't always do what you'd like them to do.  In other
words, if the computer actually multiplies 10.0 by 1.0/10.0, it might not
<em>exactly</em> get 1.0 back.
<p>That's the problem.  Now here's the solution: be <em>very</em> careful when
comparing floating point numbers for equality (or when doing other things with
floating point numbers; e.g., finding the average of two floating point
numbers seems simple but to do it right requires an <tt>if</tt>/<tt>else</tt> with at least
three cases).
<p>Here's the <em>wrong</em> way to do it:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;void&nbsp;dubious(double&nbsp;x,&nbsp;double&nbsp;y)<br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;(x&nbsp;==&nbsp;y)&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;Dubious!</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foo();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p>If what you really want is to make sure they're &quot;very close&quot; to each other
(e.g., if variable <tt>a</tt> contains the value <nobr><tt>1.0 / 10.0</tt></nobr> and you want to
see <nobr><tt>if (10*a == 1)</tt></nobr>), you'll probably want to do something fancier than
the above:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;void&nbsp;smarter(double&nbsp;x,&nbsp;double&nbsp;y)<br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;(isEqual(x,&nbsp;y))&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;Smarter!</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foo();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>...</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p>There are many ways to define the <nobr><tt>isEqual()</tt></nobr> function, including:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;inline&nbsp;bool&nbsp;isEqual(double&nbsp;x,&nbsp;double&nbsp;y)<br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;double&nbsp;epsilon&nbsp;=&nbsp;</tt><em>/*&nbsp;some&nbsp;small&nbsp;number&nbsp;such&nbsp;as&nbsp;1e-5&nbsp;*/</em><tt>;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;std::abs(x&nbsp;-&nbsp;y)&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;epsilon&nbsp;*&nbsp;std::abs(x);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;see&nbsp;Knuth&nbsp;section&nbsp;4.2.2&nbsp;pages&nbsp;217-218</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p>Note: the above solution is not completely symmetric, meaning it is possible
for <nobr><tt>isEqual(x,y)</tt></nobr> <nobr><tt>!=</tt></nobr> <nobr><tt>isEqual(y,x)</tt></nobr>.  From a practical
standpoint, does not usually occur when the magnitudes of <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are
significantly larger than <tt>epsilon</tt>, but your mileage may vary.

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.18] What is the type of an enumeration such as <nobr><tt>enum Color</tt></nobr>? Is it of type <tt>int</tt>?</h3></div>
<p>An enumeration such as <nobr><tt>enum Color { red, white, blue };</tt></nobr> is its own
type.  It is not of type <tt>int</tt>.
<p>When you create an object of an enumeration type, e.g., <nobr><tt>Color x;</tt></nobr>, we
say that the object <tt>x</tt> is of type <tt>Color</tt>.  Object <tt>x</tt>
isn't of type &quot;enumeration,&quot; and it's not of type <tt>int</tt>.
<p>An expression of an enumeration type can be <em>converted</em> to a temporary
<tt>int</tt>.  An analogy may help here.  An expression of type <tt>float</tt> can be
converted to a temporary <tt>double</tt>, but that doesn't mean <tt>float</tt> is a subtype
of <tt>double</tt>.  For example, after the declaration <nobr><tt>float y;</tt></nobr>, we say that
<tt>y</tt> is of type <tt>float</tt>, and the expression <tt>y</tt> can be converted to a temporary
<tt>double</tt>.  When that happens, a brand new, temporary <tt>double</tt> is created by
copying something out of <tt>y</tt>.  In the say way, a <tt>Color</tt> object such as
<tt>x</tt> can be converted to a temporary <tt>int</tt>, in which case a brand new,
temporary <tt>int</tt> is created by copying something out of <tt>x</tt>.  (Note: the
<em>only</em> purpose of the <tt>float</tt> / <tt>double</tt> analogy in this paragraph is to
help explain how expressions of an enumeration type can be converted to
temporary <tt>int</tt>s; do <em>not</em> try to use that analogy to imply <em>any</em>
other behavior!)
<p>The above conversion is very different from a subtype relationship, such as
the relationship between derived class <tt>Car</tt> and its base class <tt>Vehicle</tt>.
For example, an object of class <tt>Car</tt>, such as <nobr><tt>Car z;</tt></nobr>, actually
<em>is</em> an object of class <tt>Vehicle</tt>, therefore you can bind a <nobr><tt>Vehicle&amp;</tt></nobr>
to that object, e.g., <nobr><tt>Vehicle&amp; v = z;</tt></nobr>.  Unlike the previous paragraph,
the object <tt>z</tt> is not copied to a temporary; reference <tt>v</tt> binds to <tt>z</tt>
itself.  So we say an object of class <tt>Car</tt> <em>is</em> a <tt>Vehicle</tt>, but an
object of class &quot;Color&quot; simply can be copied/converted into a temporary <tt>int</tt>.
Big difference.
<p>Final note, especially for C programmers: <a href="newbie.html#faq-29.19" title="[29.19] If an enumeration type is distinct from any other type, what good is it? What can you do with it?">the C++
compiler will <em>not</em> automatically convert an <tt>int</tt> expression to a
temporary <tt>Color</tt><!--rawtext:[29.19]:rawtext--></a>.  Since that sort of conversion is unsafe, it
requires a cast, e.g., <nobr><tt>Color x = Color(2);</tt></nobr>.

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[29.19] If an enumeration type is distinct from any other type, what good is it? What can you do with it?</h3></div>
<p>Let's consider this enumeration type: <nobr><tt>enum Color { red, white, blue };</tt></nobr>.
<p>The best way to look at this (C programmers: hang on to your seats!!) is that
the values of this type are <tt>red</tt>, <tt>white</tt>, and <tt>blue</tt>, as
opposed to merely thinking of those names as constant <tt>int</tt> values.  The C++
compiler provides an automatic conversion from <tt>Color</tt> to <tt>int</tt>, and the
converted values will be, in this case, 0, 1, and 2 respectively.  But you
shouldn't think of <tt>blue</tt> as a fancy name for 2.  <tt>blue</tt> is of
type <tt>Color</tt> and there is an automatic conversion from <tt>blue</tt> to
2, but the inverse conversion, from <tt>int</tt> to <tt>Color</tt>, is <em>not</em>
provided automatically by the C++ compiler.
<p>Here is an example that illustrates the conversion from <tt>Color</tt> to
<tt>int</tt>:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;enum&nbsp;Color&nbsp;{&nbsp;red,&nbsp;white,&nbsp;blue&nbsp;};<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;void&nbsp;f()<br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;n;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;=&nbsp;red;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>n</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;0</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;=&nbsp;white;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>n</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;1</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;=&nbsp;blue;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>n</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;2</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p>The following example also demonstrates the conversion from <tt>Color</tt> to
<tt>int</tt>:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;void&nbsp;f()<br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;red;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color&nbsp;y&nbsp;=&nbsp;white;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color&nbsp;z&nbsp;=&nbsp;blue;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;n;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;=&nbsp;x;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>n</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;0</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;=&nbsp;y;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>n</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;1</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;=&nbsp;z;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>n</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;2</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p>However the inverse conversion, from <tt>int</tt> to <tt>Color</tt>, is not
automatically provided by the C++ compiler:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;void&nbsp;f()<br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color&nbsp;x;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;blue;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>x</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<tt>blue</tt></em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;2;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;compile-time&nbsp;error:&nbsp;can't&nbsp;convert&nbsp;<tt>int</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<tt>Color</tt></em><tt><br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p>The last line above shows that enumeration types are <em>not</em> <tt>int</tt>s in
disguise.  You can think of them as <tt>int</tt> types if you want to, but if you do,
you <em>must</em> remember that the C++ compiler will not implicitly convert an
<tt>int</tt> to a <tt>Color</tt>.  If you really want that, you can use a cast:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;void&nbsp;f()<br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color&nbsp;x;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;red;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>x</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<tt>red</tt></em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;Color(1);&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>x</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<tt>white</tt></em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;Color(2);&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>x</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<tt>blue</tt></em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;2;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;compile-time&nbsp;error:&nbsp;can't&nbsp;convert&nbsp;<tt>int</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<tt>Color</tt></em><tt><br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
</div>
<p>There are other ways that enumeration types are unlike <tt>int</tt>.  For example,
enumeration types don't have a <nobr><tt>++</tt></nobr> operator:
<p><div class=CodeBlock>
<tt>
&nbsp;void&nbsp;f()<br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;n&nbsp;=&nbsp;red;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>n</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;0</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;red;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>x</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<tt>red</tt></em><tt><br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n++;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;change&nbsp;<tt>n</tt>&nbsp;to&nbsp;1</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x++;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><em>//&nbsp;compile-time&nbsp;error:&nbsp;can't&nbsp;<nobr><tt>++</tt></nobr>&nbsp;an&nbsp;enumeration</em><tt><br>
&nbsp;}
</tt>
