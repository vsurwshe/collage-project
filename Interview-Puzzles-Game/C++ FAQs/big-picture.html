<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.1] Is C++ a practical language?</h3></div>
<p>Yes.
<p>C++ is a practical tool.  <a href="big-picture.html#faq-6.2" title="[6.2] Is C++ a perfect language?">It's not perfect<!--rawtext:[6.2]:rawtext--></a>, but
it's useful.
<p>In the world of industrial software, C++ is viewed as a solid, mature,
mainstream tool.  It has widespread industry support which makes it &quot;good&quot; from
an overall business perspective.

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.2] Is C++ a perfect language?</h3></div>
<p>Nope.
<p>C++ wasn't designed to demonstrate what a perfect OO language looks like.  It
was designed to be a practical tool for solving real world problems.  It has a
few warts, but the only place where it's appropriate to keep fiddling with
something until it's perfect is in a pure academic setting.  That wasn't C++'s
goal.

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.3] What's the big deal with OO?</h3></div>
<p>Object-oriented techniques are the best way we know of to develop large,
complex software applications and systems.
<p>OO hype: the software industry is &quot;failing&quot; to meet demands for large, complex
software systems.  But this failure is actually due to our <em>successes:</em>
our successes have propelled users to ask for more.  Unfortunately we created a
market hunger that Structured Analysis, Design and Programming techniques
couldn't satisfy.  This required us to create a better paradigm.
<p>C++ supports OO programming.  C++ can also be used as a traditional
programming language (as &quot;as a better C&quot;).  However if you use it &quot;as a better
C,&quot; don't expect to get the benefits of object-oriented programming.

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.4] Is C++ better than Ada? (or Visual Basic, C, FORTRAN, Pascal, Smalltalk, or any other language?)</h3></div>
<p>This question generates much <em>much</em> more heat than light.  Please read
the following before posting some variant of this question.
<p>In 99% of the cases, programming language selection is dominated by business
considerations, <em>not</em> by technical considerations.  Things that
<em>really</em> end up mattering are things like availability of a programming
environment for the development machine, availability of runtime environment(s)
for the deployment machine(s), licensing/legal issues of the runtime and/or
development environments, availability of trained developers, availability of
consulting services, and corporate culture/politics.  These business
considerations generally play a much greater role than compile time
performance, runtime performance, static <em>vs.</em> dynamic typing, static <em>vs.</em> dynamic
binding, etc.
<p>Anyone who argues in favor of one language over another in a purely technical
manner (i.e., who ignores the dominant business issues) exposes themself as a
techie weenie, and deserves not to be heard.

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.5] Who uses C++?</h3></div>
<p>Lots and lots of companies and government sites.  Lots.
<p>The large number of developers (and therefore the large amount of available
support infrastructure including vendors, tools, training, etc.) is one of
several <a href="big-picture.html#faq-6.7" title="[6.7] What are some features of C++ from a business perspective?">critical features of C++<!--rawtext:[6.7]:rawtext--></a>.

<p><a name="faq-6.6"></a>
<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.6] How long does it take to learn OO/C++?</h3></div>
<p>Companies successfully teach standard industry &quot;short courses,&quot; where a
university semester course is compressed into one 40 hour work week.  But
regardless of where you get your training, make sure the courses have a
hands-on element, since most people learn best when they have projects to help
the concepts &quot;gel.&quot; But even if they have the <em>best</em> training, they're
not ready yet.
<p>It takes 6-12 months to become proficient in OO/C++.  Less if the developers
have easy access to a &quot;local&quot; body of experts, more if there isn't a &quot;good&quot;
general purpose C++ class library available.  To become one of these experts
who can mentor others takes around 3 years.
<p>Some people never make it.  You don't have a chance unless you are teachable
and have personal drive.  As a bare minimum on &quot;teachability,&quot; you have to be
able to admit when you've been wrong.  As a bare minimum on &quot;drive,&quot; you must be
willing to put in some extra hours (it's a <em>lot</em> easier to learn some new
facts than it is to change your paradigm [i.e., to change the <em>way</em> you
think; to change your notion of goodness; to change your mental model of the
world of technology]).
<p>Two things you <em>should</em> do:

<hr>
<p><a name="faq-6.8"></a>
<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.8] Are <tt>virtual</tt> functions (dynamic binding) central to OO/C++?</h3></div>
<p><em>Yes!</em>
<p>Without <a href="virtual-functions.html" title="[20] Inheritance -- virtual functions">virtual functions<!--rawtext:[20]:rawtext--></a>, C++ wouldn't be
object-oriented.  <a href="operator-overloading.html" title="[13] Operator overloading">Operator overloading<!--rawtext:[13]:rawtext--></a> and
non-<tt>virtual</tt> member functions are great, but they are, after all, just
syntactic sugar for the more typical C notion of passing a pointer to a
<tt>struct</tt> to a function.  The <a href="class-libraries.html#faq-36.1" title="[36.1] What is the &quot;STL&quot;?">standard library<!--rawtext:[36.1]:rawtext--></a> contains numerous
templates that illustrate &quot;generic programming&quot; techniques, which are also
great, but <tt>virtual</tt> functions are still at the heart of object-oriented
programming using C++.
<p>From a business perspective, there is very little reason to switch from
straight C to C++ without <tt>virtual</tt> functions (for now we'll ignore generic
programming and <a href="class-libraries.html#faq-36.1" title="[36.1] What is the &quot;STL&quot;?">the standard library<!--rawtext:[36.1]:rawtext--></a>).  Technical
people often think that there is a large difference between C and non-OO C++,
but without OO, the difference usually isn't enough to justify the cost of
training developers, new tools, etc.  In other words, if I were to advise a
manager regarding whether to switch from C to non-OO C++ (i.e., to switch
languages but not paradigms), I'd probably discourage him or her unless there
were compelling tool-oriented reasons.  From a business perspective, OO can
help make systems extensible and adaptable, but just the syntax of C++ classes
without OO may not even reduce the maintenance cost, and it surely adds to the
training cost significantly.
<p>Bottom line: C++ without <tt>virtual</tt> is not OO.  Programming with classes but
without dynamic binding is called &quot;object based,&quot; but not &quot;object oriented.&quot;
Throwing out <tt>virtual</tt> functions is the same as throwing out OO.  All you have
left is object-based programming, similar to the original Ada language (the new
Ada language, by the way, supports true OO rather than just object-based
programming).

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.9] I'm from Missouri. Can you give me a simple reason why <tt>virtual</tt> functions (dynamic binding) make a big difference?</h3></div>
<p>Dynamic binding can improve reuse by letting <em>old</em> code call
<em>new</em> code.
<p>Before OO came along, reuse was accomplished by having new code call old code.
For example, a programmer might write some code that called some reusable code
such as <nobr><tt>printf()</tt></nobr>.
<p>With OO, reuse can also be accomplished by having <em>old</em> code call
<em>new</em> code.  For example, a programmer might write some code that is
called by a framework that was written by their great, great grandfather.
There's no need to change great-great-grandpa's code.  In fact, it doesn't even
need to be recompiled.  Even if all you have left is the object file and the
source code that great-great-grandpa wrote was lost 25 years ago, that ancient
object file will call the new extension without anything falling apart.
<p><em>That</em> is extensibility, and <em>that</em> is OO.

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.10] Is C++ backward compatible with ANSI/ISO C?</h3></div>
<p>Almost.
<p>C++ is as close as possible to compatible with C, but no closer.  In practice,
the major difference is that C++ requires prototypes, and that <nobr><tt>f()</tt></nobr> declares
a function that takes no parameters (in C, a function declared using <nobr><tt>f()</tt></nobr> can
be passed an arbitrary number of parameters of arbitrary types).
<p>There are some very subtle differences as well, like <nobr><tt>sizeof('x')</tt></nobr> is equal to
<nobr><tt>sizeof(char)</tt></nobr> in C++ but is equal to <nobr><tt>sizeof(int)</tt></nobr> in C.  Also, C++ puts
structure &quot;tags&quot; in the same namespace as other names, whereas C requires an
explicit <tt>struct</tt> (e.g., the <nobr><tt>typedef struct Fred Fred;</tt></nobr> technique still
works, but is redundant in C++).

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.11] Is C++ standardized?</h3></div>
<p>Yes.
<p>The C++ standard was finalized and adopted by ISO (International Organization
for Standardization) as well as several national standards organizations such
as ANSI (The American National Standards Institute), BSI (The British Standards
Institute), DIN (The German National Standards Organization).  The ISO standard
was finalized and adopted by unanimous vote November 14, 1997.
<p>The ANSI C++ committee is called &quot;X3J16&quot;.  The ISO C++ standards group is
called &quot;WG21&quot;.  The major players in the ANSI/ISO C++ standards process
include just about everyone: representatives from Australia, Canada, Denmark,
France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, the UK,
and the USA, along with representatives from about a hundred companies and many
interested individuals.  Major players include AT&amp;T, Ericsson, Digital,
Borland, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Mentor Graphics, Microsoft, Silicon Graphics,
Sun Microsystems, and Siemens.  After about 8 years of work, this standard is
now complete.  On November 14, 1997, the standard was approved by a unanimous
vote of the countries that had representatives present in Morristown.

<p>Note: The ISO document is well over ten times more expensive than the ANSI
document, however the technical content is the same.  The ISO document has a
different title page, but the technical material is identical to the ANSI
document.  Please don't email asking me why ISO charges so much more for
fundamentally the same thing; that's ISO's business decision; you'll have to
take it up with ISO's publishing/sales department.
<p>There are at least two ways to get a hard-copy of this document:

your shopping basket.&quot;</li>
<li>Unknown price [published by ANSI]: call NCITS (National Committee

<p>There are two other potentially interesting (and free) documents you might
want to look at:
<ul>
<li>$0: If you're willing to put up with a (free) document that's
non-authorative, out-of-date, and partially incorrect, you can get &quot;committee

<li>$0: The ISO committee's press release (<em>not</em> a copy of the
ANSI or ISO standards!) is

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.13] What are some &quot;interview questions&quot; I could ask that would let me know if candidates really know their stuff?</h3></div>
<p>This answer is primarily for non-technical managers and HR folks who are
trying to do a good job at interviewing C++ candidates.  If you're a C++
programmer about to be interviewed, and if you're lurking in this FAQ hoping
to know the questions they'll ask you ahead of time so you can avoid having to
<em>really</em> learn C++, shame on you: spend your time becoming technically
competent and you won't have to try to &quot;cheat&quot; your way through life!
<p>Back to the non-technical manager / HR person: obviously you are eminently
qualified to judge whether a candidate is a good &quot;fit&quot; with your company's
culture.  However there are enough charlatans, wannabes, and posers out there
that you really need to team up with someone who is technically competent in
order to make sure the candidate has the right level of technical skill.  A
lot of companies have been burned by hiring nice but incompetent duds &#151;
people who were incompetent in spite of the fact that they knew the answers to
a few obscure questions.  The only way to smoke out the posers and wannabes is
to get someone in with you who can ask penetrating technical questions.  You
have no hope whatsoever of doing that yourself.  Even if I gave you a bunch of
&quot;tricky questions,&quot; they wouldn't smoke out the bad guys.
<p>Your technical sidekick might not be (and often isn't) qualified to judge the
candidate on personality or soft skills, so please don't abdicate your role as
the final arbiter in the decision making process.  But please don't think you
can ask a half dozen C++ questions and have the slightest clue if the
candidate <em>really</em> knows what they're talking about from a technical
perspective.
<p>Having said all that, <em>if</em> you're technical enough to read the C++ FAQ,
you can dig up a lot of good interview questions here.  The FAQ has a
<em>lot</em> of goodies that will separate the wheat from the chaff.  The FAQ
focuses on what programmers should do, as opposed to merely what the compiler
will let them do.  There are things that can be done in C++ but shouldn't be
done.  The FAQ helps people separate those two.

<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.14] What does the FAQ mean by &quot;such-in-such is <em>evil</em>&quot;?</h3></div>
<p>It means <em>such-in-such</em> is something you should avoid most of the time,
but <em>not</em> something you should avoid <em>all</em> the time.  For example,
you will end up using these &quot;evil&quot; things whenever they are &quot;the least evil of
the evil alternatives.&quot; It's a joke, okay?  Don't take it too seriously.
<p>The real purpose of the term (<em>&quot;Ah ha,&quot;</em> I hear you saying, <em>&quot;there
really <b>is</b> a hidden motive!&quot;</em>; you're right: there is) is to
shake new C++ programmers free from some of their old thinking.  For example,
C programmers who are new to C++ often use pointers, arrays and/or <nobr><tt>#define</tt></nobr>
more than they should.  The FAQ lists those as &quot;evil&quot; to give new C++
programmers a vigorous (and droll!) shove in the right direction.  The goal of
farcical things like &quot;pointers are evil&quot; is to convince new C++ programmers
that C++ really isn't &quot;just like C except for those silly <nobr><tt>//</tt></nobr> comments.&quot;
<p>Now let's get real here.  I'm not suggesting macros or arrays or pointers are
right up there with murder or kidnapping.  Well, maybe pointers.  (Just
kidding!) So don't get all hyper about the word &quot;evil&quot;: it's supposed to
sound a little outrageous.  So don't look for a technically precise definition
of exactly when something is or isn't &quot;evil&quot;: there isn't one.
<p>Another thing: things labeled as &quot;evil&quot; (macros, arrays, pointers, etc.)
aren't <em>always</em> bad in <em>all</em> situations.  When they are the
&quot;least bad&quot; of the alternatives, <a href="big-picture.html#faq-6.15" title="[6.15] Will I sometimes use any so-called &quot;evil&quot; constructs?">use
them<!--rawtext:[6.15]:rawtext--></a>!

<p><a name="faq-6.15"></a>
<div class=FaqTitle><h3>[6.15] Will I sometimes use any so-called &quot;evil&quot; constructs?</h3></div>
<p>Of <em>course</em> you will!
<p>One size does not fit all.  Stop.  Right now, take out a fine-point marker and
write on the inside of your glasses: <em>Software Development <b>Is</b>
Decision Making</em>.  &quot;Think&quot; is not a four-letter word.  There are very few
if any &quot;never...&quot; and &quot;always...&quot; rules in software &#151; rules that you can
apply without thinking &#151; rules that always work in all situations in all
markets &#151; one-size-fits-all rules.
<p>In plain English, you <em>will</em> have to make decisions, and the quality of
your decisions <em>will</em> effect the business value of your software.  And
sometimes you will have to choose between a bunch of bad options.  When that
happens, the best you can hope for is to choose the <em>least bad</em> of the
alternatives, the lesser of the &quot;evils.&quot;
<p>So you <em>will</em> end up using approaches and techniques labeled as &quot;evil.&quot;
If that makes you uncomfortable, mentally change the word &quot;evil&quot; to
&quot;frequently undesirable&quot; (but don't quit your day job to become an author:
<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=milquetoast" title="www.dictionary.com/search?q=milquetoast" target='_blank'>milquetoast</a>
terms like that put people to sleep :-)
