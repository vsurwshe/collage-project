Think about the following points. Do any of them apply to you? 

Oversell 

Trying too hard to impress; bragging; acting aggressively. 

Undersell

 Failing to emphasize the fact that you have related skills; discussing 

experience using negative qualifiers (i.e. "I have a little experience..."). 

Body Language 

It is easy to create a negative impression without even realizing that you 

are doing it. Are you staring at your feet, or talking to the interviewer's 

shoulder? Be aware of what your actions say about you. 

Lack of Honesty 

The slightest stretching of the truth may result in you being screened out. 

Negative Attitude 

The interview is not an opportunity for you to complain about your 

current supervisor or co-workers (or even about 'little' things, such as 

the weather). 

Lack of Preparation 

You have to know about the organization and the occupation. If you 

don't, it will appear as though you are not interested in the position. 

Lack of 

Enthusiasm 

If you are not excited about the work at the interview, the employer will 

not assume that your attitude will improve when hired.
