About this application:

Invoicing is a web application written in PHP that can be used for simple invoicing needs.
Most of the code of Invoicing was automatically generated by AppGini, a web application generator
that you can find more on at http://bigprof.com/appgini.



System requirements:

Invoicing can run on any web server with PHP 4.3 or higher and MySQL 3.25 or higher installed.
If you want to use/test it on your own computer, the easiest way is to install XAMPP from
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html



Installation:

1. Create an empty mysql database on your server (usually done from your hosting control panel)
and assign a username and password to access it.

2. Upload all the files and sub folders in this folder into your web/intranet server. Let's say
your server is my-server.com and that you uploaded Invoicing to a folder named "invoicing" under your
public_html folder (or whatever your web root is named). So, you can access the program from:
http://my-server.com/invoicing

Just follow the setup screens you'll see when accessing the above address, and you're done.




Usage:

1. Login as admin.
2. Define one or more clients from the clients page.
3. You're now ready to create invoices! Just go to the invoices page and define invoices as you wish.



More info, adding more features, ... etc:

Invoicing was generated by AppGini (http://bigprof.com/appgini) ... You can easily customize it by
opening the file "invoices.axp" in AppGini and making all changes you wish to (add more fields, more tables, ... etc),
then click the Generate icon and re-upload the generated code. No programming skills necessary!
